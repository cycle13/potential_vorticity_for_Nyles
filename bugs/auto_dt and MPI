auto_dt should be set to False when using MPI.
For now, each core calculates its own dt, so at the end they calculate at different times.

Suggestion :
Before exchanging halo, they should calculate their dt at share it between everyone. 
Then they should all pick the smallest dt for the next step.

To be implemented soon
