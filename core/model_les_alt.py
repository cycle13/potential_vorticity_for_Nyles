"""Alternative, unfinished implementation of the LES model.

This implementation was proposed by Markus Reinert on 25 Oct 2019.  It
was never finished and it is not up-2-date with recent developments,
since the team decided to push the development of the file now called
"model_les.py".  This file may be completed in the future to compare the
two approaches or it may be used as a starting point to implement other
models like the hydrostatic model.



The update of the state variables is implemented like this:
 1. Calculate delta_b, delta_u, delta_U and update p in compute_rhs.
 2. Increment b, u, U by their respective deltas in the timescheme.
 3. Calculate omega and kinetic energy in compute_diagnostic_variables.

Advantages:
 - The velocity has directly the correct value instead of an
   intermediate value.
 - No need to handle p separately.

Disadvantage:
 - Non-divergence is not imposed explicitly, but only implicitly.

Alternatively, it is possible to move the calculation of U into step 3.
This increases the amount of calculations necessary by one matrix
multiplication, but restores the distinction between prognostic and
diagnostic variables.  Also it prevents the accumulation of errors in
U with respect to u.

Conversely, it is possible to handle omega like a prognostic variable.
This, together with removing KE from the model variables, allows to get
rid of step 3, in which case no modification of the time-stepping is
necessary.  However, this has the potential risk that small errors in
the calculation of delta_omega accumulate and thus the relation between
u and omega is violated over time.  Also it removes the distinction
between prognostic and diagnostic variables almost completely, except
for p.
