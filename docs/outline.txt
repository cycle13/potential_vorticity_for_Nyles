* We will work on several components

  - the data structure: how do we store the 3D arrays

        * we need to anticipate the halo fill

        * anticipate that we want to distinguish covariant and
          contravariant components, even though the distinction is
          trivial in Cartesian coordinates.

  - computation of the model r.h.s.
        * our guidelines are
            data contiguity + maximize computational intensity,
          i.e., maximal number of calculations for a single call of a
          Fortran function

  - multigrid

  - parallelization

        * write things to be as general as possible:
          subdomain partition can be anything (but must be a power of 2)

        * halo fill: it should be flexible: fill only two faces,
          fill the 6 faces, fill the 6 faces and the 8 corners etc.

        * gather arrays and matrix A [for the multigrid]


* For each subroutine we should systematically

  - write the docstring

  - write one or several tests:

        * of the subroutine itself

        * of its interaction with other parts of the software

  - use the tests before commiting changes


* At this stage of the development, don't be afraid to rewrite things
  completely => e.g. the data structure is central and impacts a lot
  the way the rest of the code is written
